# Vectors
A quantity that has both direction and magnitude.

This is often represented by an arrow pointing in the direction with a length = its magnitude.

Can also be an ordered list of numbers.

## Notation
### 2D Vectors
$$
\huge
\begin{aligned}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ -3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-6 \\ 5
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

2D vectors are represented by a vertical pair of numbers surrounded by square brackets. 

The first number represents the distance to move along the x-axis.

The second number represents the distance to move along y-axis.

### 3D Vectors

$$
\huge
\begin{aligned}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ -3 \\ 4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
-6 \\ 5 \\ -2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

3D vectors are just like 2D vectors except there is a third number added to the bottom of the pair.

This third number represents the distance to move along the z-axis.
